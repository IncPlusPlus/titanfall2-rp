# Playlist Icons

These are the icons that show up when selecting what game modes you want to queue for. The screenshot blow shows these icons. They're a little rough around the edges but they should be fine given my intent to use them as the "small image" in Discord's Rich Presence status.

I nabbed these from the Remnant Fleet Discord server. These icons are the work of mrvn4 (Octo#8859).
