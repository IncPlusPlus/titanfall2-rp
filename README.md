# Titanfall 2 Discord Rich Presence

This project aims to allow for Discord's Rich Presence feature to work with Titanfall 2. This is accomplished in a very hacky way. Specifically, known memory addresses are directly read from by this program. Yes, you read that right. I had to mess around in Cheat Engine to find the right memory addresses to read various values from. It's incredibly hacky but at least the code is relatively elegant if I say so myself.

## Usage
At the moment, there is no install process. Go to [the releases page](https://github.com/IncPlusPlus/titanfall2-rp/releases) or directly to the [latest release](https://github.com/IncPlusPlus/titanfall2-rp/releases/latest) and then download the `.exe` file from the release assets. If that's too much for you, you probably shouldn't be here :/

You're still here? Fine. If you really couldn't follow the instructions above, just click [here](https://github.com/IncPlusPlus/titanfall2-rp/releases/latest/download/titanfall2-rp.exe). Just promise me one thing. Never _**ever**_ file a bug report.
